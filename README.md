# Investigation Game

## Overview
A console-based investigation game where the player tries to expose Iranian agents in a room using different types of sensors. Each agent has specific "weaknesses" corresponding to sensor types, and the player needs to match sensors to these weaknesses to expose the agent.

The game supports saving user progress in a MySQL database.

## Project Structure

### Main Namespaces

- `investigation.iranianAgents`  
  Classes representing Iranian agents of various types:
  - `Agent` (abstract base class)
  - Specific agents: `FootSoldier`, `SquadLeader`, `SeniorCommander`, `OrganizationLeader`
  - `IAttackAgent` interface for agents with counterattack capability
  - `AgentFactory` to create agent instances

- `investigation.sensors`  
  Sensor classes:
  - Base class `Sensor` and specific sensor classes: `AudioSensor`, `ThermalSensor`, `PulseSensor`, `MotionSensor`, `MagneticSensor`
  - `SensorFactory` to create sensors by type

- `investigation.room`  
  `Room` class containing an array of attached sensors and computing matches between sensors and an agent's weaknesses

- `investigation.manager`  
  Handles game logic:
  - `InvestigationSupport` ‚Äì manages connections between agent, room, sensors; activates sensors; handles attacks, etc.
  - `InvestigationController` ‚Äì user interface, console input/output, investigation rounds, saving progress

- `investigation.DataBase`  
  Static class `DalUserProgress` for saving/loading user progress from MySQL database

- `investigation`  
  The `Program` class containing the `Main` method that runs the game loop

---

## Requirements and Database

- MySQL installed and running on localhost
- Database named `investigationgame`
- Table `users` with columns:
  - `username` (primary key, VARCHAR(255))
  - `currentAgentIndex` (INT)

The table is created automatically by the code if it doesn't exist.

## How to Run

1. Make sure MySQL is running with default settings (server=localhost, user=root, no password).
2. Run the console application and enter your username.
3. You will be prompted to select an index (location) to attach a sensor and choose a sensor type.
4. The game will activate sensors and check matches against the agent's weaknesses.
5. When all required sensors are matched, the agent is exposed and the game moves to the next agent.
6. Progress is saved in the database and loaded automatically on next sessions for the same user.
7. The game ends when all agents are exposed.

## Important Classes and Methods

### Agent (abstract)
- Properties: `type`, `weaknessSensors`
- Methods:
  - `GetSensorRequirementCount()` ‚Äì returns a dictionary with sensor types and counts required for the agent's weaknesses

### IAttackAgent (interface)
- Property: `CounterAttack`
- Method: `Attack(Sensor[] sensors)`

### AgentFactory
- `createAgent(int index, List<string> sensorTypes)` - creates an agent by index

### Sensor (abstract)
- Properties: `type`, `active`
- Method: `Activate()`

### SensorFactory
- `CreateSensor(string type)` - creates a sensor by type string

### Room
- Holds an array `attachedSensore` of sensors
- `Attach(int index, Sensor sensor)`
- `NumOfMatches(Dictionary<string,int> weaknessSensors)` ‚Äì returns the count of matching active sensors vs agent weaknesses

### InvestigationSupport
- Holds references to Agent, Room, and list of sensor types
- `InitNewAgent(Agent agent)`
- `AttachSensor(int index, Sensor sensor)`
- `ActivateSensors()`
- `HandleAttack()`
- `GetMatchCount()`, `IsFullMatched()`

### InvestigationController
- Manages user input/output and game flow
- Calls save/load progress
- Game loop controller

### DalUserProgress
- `LoadProgress(string userName)` - loads user progress from database
- `SaveProgress(string userName, int currentAgentIndex)` - saves progress to database
